# Mineminenomi Unleashed
Decompled deobfuscated version of The [Mine Mine No Mi](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/mine-mine-no-mi) Mod created by (WyndFTWz) and (FGpisces) for version 1.15.2-0.8.1
(compadabiltiy and improvements on the way)  

Decompled with [Java Decompiler](http://java-decompiler.github.io/)
then alot of the code broken by Java Decompiler and fixed with[FernFlower](https://github.com/fesh0r/fernflower) to compare bronken functions.


## Improvement Plans
* Ability Use Log

 have a toggle in the config so when a player uses an ability it will be logged. Allow for a blacklist to exclude non destructive abilites like gepo

* Doriki Cap

Have the Max Integer Limit be the max range on the "Doriki Limit" config option.  Will cause issue with health vaules, but there may be a way around that.

In same vane hava a config option for setting specific doriki requirements for abilities example ""

* Ability Zones
Doriki Limit
